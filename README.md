## Webpages
_Homepage:_ Starting with the bedroom, users can navigate to different pages by clicking on different objects such as the window, clock (still in development), calendar (still in development), etc.

_Conversation with the Angel:_ After clicking on the Garden Scene, users can talk with an angel to receive a quest. Users can either: 1. Enter a task idea, which the angel will then break down the task into specific steps, or 2. Enter the progress manually with the given template. After final confirmation with the angel, the quest will be marked as accepted and the angel will generate a flower seed to the user.

_Garden_: When the user receives the seed, they are able to plant the seed down in order to "start the quest". Every time the user marks a checkbox, it will water the flower and it will grow up after a certain percentage. The user can start multiple quests at the same time while completing the task at a specific time and will receive a bonus at the end.
